# git-tab-killer 

Closes all open Git working tree and index tabs. Simply `extension.killGitTabs` to your favorite shortcut and you're good to go. 

Unfortunately, the VS Code API does not provide a list of open editors, so the only way to identify Git tabs is to cycle through all open editors and eliminate Git tabs one by one. Expect a whole bunch of screen flickering.
